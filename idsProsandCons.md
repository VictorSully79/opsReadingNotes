## Synopsis

A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) can be an integral part of an organization’s security, but they are just one aspect of many in a cohesive and safe system.

## What Is an Intrusion Detection System

Intrusion detection systems are a lot like fire alarms. Just as a fire alarm detects smoke, an intrusion detection system idenitifies incidents and potential threats. They are incredibly useful for raising awareness, but if you don’t hear the alarm or react appropriately, your house may burn down.

## Intrusion Detection Systems vs. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

An IPS is similar to an IDS, except that they are able to block potential threats as well. They monitor, log and report activities, similarly to an IDS, but they are also capable of stopping threats without the system administrator getting involved.

## Network Intrusion Detection Systems vs. Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)

An NIDS and an HIDS are complementary systems that differ by the position of the sensors: network-based (monitoring the ethernet or WiFi) and host-based, respectively. Because of this, their uses and deployment are quite different.
