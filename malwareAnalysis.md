# What Is Malware Analysis? Definition, Types, Stages, and Best Practices

Defined as *Malware analysis is defined as “the process of breaking down malware into its core components and source code, investigating its characteristics, functionality, origin, and impact to mitigate the threat and prevent future occurrences.”*

Breakdown

1. It breaks down the malware: A big part of malware analysis is demystifying malware and cyberthreats to increase awareness. After all, malware is only a software program written with the expressed purpose of causing harm. Understanding the code and how it works is integral to blocking malware entry or, at least, its spread across your ecosystem.
2. It investigates its characteristics: Every software will leave a unique digital footprint, and malware is no different. How does a specific malware variant or family approach data? How does it spread? What is its pace of replication and tactic for camouflage? Knowing the exact characteristics of malware makes it easier to detect it.
3. It unravels its functionality: This is a critical element of malware analysis, and it is difficult to get right. Malware will typically wait in hiding until the right time to attack. This means its functionality will not become clear to the user before it is too late. Malware analysis tries to determine the intended functionality of the software by reviewing its code.
4. It traces the malware’s origin: Malware can be notoriously hard to trace, and hackers take advantage of this by holding data ransom for large amounts. Malware analysis tries to see beyond the anonymization of the coder and trace it back to its origin — a person, an IP, a geographic location, or even an organization, among others. This helps in the swift intervention of legal authorities during an attack.
5. It tries to predict the impact: By putting the above threads of investigation together, it is possible to arrive at a probable impact profile. Its functionality, nature of target systems, the pace of growth, and preferred distribution channels indicate the worst-case scenario impact of malware. This enables companies to plan and deploy mitigation procedures.
