# Git Hub
## What is Github?
### Github is a pipeline for information. I think of it as free cloud storage. If I want to work on code from multiple platforms or code with others, github is the way to go.  I have been using it for about six months and love it.  

### There is talk of github going to more of a GUI interface because the command line instructions can be frustrating for a lot of people not familiar with the system.  I am indifferent. 

# Visual Studio Code
## What is it?
##### notes taken from: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs

### According to the website "Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity)."

### There are many advantages for using Visual Studio Code. Among them are the many extensions available.  Being able to code with multiple colors is helpful when reading and fixing syntax. 

### VSC is also helpful when collaborating with others.  It offers options for two people to work on the same page at the same time.  The availability of multiple open windows helps keep code and actions organized.  It is well-supported and generally easy to use.
