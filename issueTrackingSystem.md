## The Role of the Help Desk Professional

IT professionals are depended upon by the entire organization to keep technical stuff operating. This is not only technical but also includes the traditional soft skills found in customer service roles.

There are several tiers in the support infrastructure. IT professionals are the first line of defense when it comes to issues. These people need to be ready, in the event that they cannot resolve an incident, to follow the protocol in place to escalate the matter.

In general people call when they have a problem that needs to be resolved. The IT professional should have the technical know-how to solve these issues and the customer service ettiquette to keep them happy.

**Hard Skills** are defined as *"measurable skills such as configuring and troubleshooting systems."*

**Soft Skills** *"ability to communicate effectively with others"*.
