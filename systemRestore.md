## What is System Restore?
### Basically when you are messing around with your system and you have an "oops" moment, system restore allows you to revert to a previous software, registry and driver configuration.

### This configuration is a restore point.

### You can find System Restore in the Control Panel.

### At times there may be a need to know what is going to be effected.  The "Scan for affected programs" button can be chosen. It will give you an informational report that may be helpful if the system continues to have problems. 

### System Restore does not affect non system files. Documents, video and emails will be left untouched. 

### Restore points can be created manually or, when enabled, System Restore will create them automatically at critical junctures.
