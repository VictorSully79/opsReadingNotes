Windows Registry is a large database Windows uses to store configuration settings.

## How does it work

Windows registry is compiled from several databases. There are multiple settings. i.e system wide and all users.

Windows automatically loads the settings so with any luck you never need to use them.

The different groups in the registry are called "hives". Basically because the guy that named them hated bee's.

## Why edit the registry

Registry editing is done with the aptly named Registry Editor. There are many online databases that contain registry hacks that allow users to accomplish particular tasks.

Caution must be taken when messing around with the registry as it could cause system failures. 

## Some Cool Registry Hacks:
