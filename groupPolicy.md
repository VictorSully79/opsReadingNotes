## What is Group Policy

Group Policy is a Windows feature with a wide variety of advanced settings network admins can use to control and configure the computers and accounts in Active Directory.

A Group Policy Object (GPO) are groups of settings created using the Management Console (MMC).

GPOs are applied in a logical order:

    1. local policies
    2. site policies
    3. domain policies
    4. OU policies

Common applications include setting the browser home page, define printers and tweak security protocols.

## Benefits

- Setting password policies to ensure they are regularly changed.

- Simplify mundane tasks

- Deploy software updates and patches.
