# What is a Security Operations Center (SOC)

notes taken from <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/data-insider/what-is-a-security-operations-center.html>

A security operations center (SOC), also called an information security operations center (ISOC), is a centralized location where an information security team monitors, detects, analyzes and responds to cybersecurity incidents, typically on a 24/7/365 basis.

## Importance

 SOCs offer assurance that threats will be detected and prevented in real time.

- Respond faster: The SOC provides a centralized, complete, real-time view of how the entire infrastructure is performing from a security standpoint, even if you have several locations and thousands of endpoints. You can detect, identify, prevent and resolve issues before they cause too much trouble for the business.
- Protect consumer and customer trust: Consumers are already skeptical of most companies and are worried about their privacy. Creating a SOC to protect consumer and customer data can help build trust in your organization. And of course, preventing breaches protects that trust.
- Minimize costs: While many organizations think establishing a SOC is cost prohibitive, the cost associated with a breach — including the loss of data, corrupted data or customer defection — are much higher. Additionally, SOC personnel will ensure that you’re using the right tools for your business to their full potential, so you won’t waste money on ineffective tools.

## What do they do

- Proactive, around-the-clock surveillance of networks, hardware and software for threat and breach detection, and incident response.
- Expertise on all the tools your organization uses, including third-party vendors, to ensure they can easily resolve security issues.
- Installation, updating and troubleshooting of application software.
- Monitoring and managing of firewall and intrusion prevention systems.
- Scanning and remediation of antivirus, malware and ransomware solutions.
- Email, voice and video traffic management.
- Patch management and whitelisting.
- Deep analysis of security log data from various sources.
- Analysis, investigation and documentation of security trends.
- Investigation of security breaches to understand the root cause of attacks and prevent future breaches.
- Enforcement of security policies and procedures.
- Backup, storage and recovery.
