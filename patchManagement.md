notes taken from the above named article: <https://www.howtogeek.com/443161/what-is-patch-tuesday-for-windows-and-when-is-it/>

Microsoft releases large update packages on the second Tuesday of the month.

*Sometimes called “Update Tuesday,” Patch Tuesday is an unofficial term for the day when Microsoft releases update packages for the Windows operating system and other Microsoft software applications, including Microsoft Office.*

This is done so IT professionals can predict and plan.

If there is a critical flaw it can be released earlier.

In time other companies have followed suit using the second Tuesday.
