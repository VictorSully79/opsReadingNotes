## How do I know if my SSD is failing?

SSDs lack many of the failing signs of older spinning disk HDDs. With education a person can learn to know the signs. 

- Bad blocks  “bad blocks”—storage segments that, through memory corruption or physical damage, impede data storage and retrieval functions.

- File system repair  If a computer or file system requires repair but physical defect software shows no damage, this could indicate an issue with the connector port.

- Crashing If a computer crashes while booting up but seems to work normally after several reboots, the SSD is probably failing.

- Read Only Mode It is possible for SSDs to cease functioning except in read-only mode.

## How do you fix a failed SSD

If its a physical problem the drive may need to be replaced.  However, if the dysfunction derives from a logical error—bad blocks, software malfunctions, malware, outdated firmware, etc.—a handful of techniques may achieve SSD recovery.

- Formatting the drive and redownloading the operating system.
  
- Power cycling the SSD. If the SSD drive becomes corrupted through power failure, this method may be the solution. First, unplug the SATA data cable, but leave the power cable in. Leave the power on for half an hour, then turn it off for 30 seconds. Turn the power back on again for another half hour. Finally, turn it off for another 30 seconds. Turn the power back on and reconnect the data cable. If power cycling has been effective, the SSD will be back up at this point.
  
- Idling in the boot menu. This method is similar to power cycling, except that while the power is on during the half-hour intervals, the computer should be left to idle in the boot menu. On a PC, boot into BIOS and sit at the BIOS screen. On a Mac, get to the boot menu by turning on the computer while holding down the ALT key.
  
- Updating SSD firmware. It’s possible that the storage drive’s firmware, which is integral to hard drive operations, has been corrupted. When firmware is bad, it can affect the drive’s ability to access, read, and write data. Run a firmware update tool to check whether the SSD has the latest version. If it doesn’t, install it and wait to see if functionality (and data access) is restored. Unfortunately, if firmware becomes too damaged, even professionals cannot reverse its effects, and data may be lost forever.
  
- Updating drivers. In Windows, simply check the Device Manager, go to Disk Drives, and right-click the SSD to update the driver. After rebooting, you may be able to see the revived SSD.
