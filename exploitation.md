# What is Metasploit? And how to use this popular hacking tool

Metasploit is a penetration testing framework that makes hacking simple. It's an essential tool for many attackers and defenders. Point Metasploit at your target, pick an exploit, what payload to drop, and hit Enter.

HD Moore began working on Metasploit in the early oughts, and released 1.0, written in Perl, in 2003. The project has grown dramatically since then, from the original 11 exploits the project came with to more than 1,500 now, plus around 500 payloads, with a switch to Ruby under the hood along the way.

Security outfit Rapid7 acquired both Metasploit and Moore in 2009. (Moore left the project in 2016.) Metasploit has since become the de facto framework for exploit development, despite competition from Canvas and Core Impact. Today it is common for zero day reports to include a Metasploit module as proof of concept.
