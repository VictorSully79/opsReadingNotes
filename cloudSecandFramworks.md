## Seperation of Duties

Basically the more you pay the more Amazon will do for you.

AWS has found that there needs to be many levels of service to accomodate the myriad of customer needs. AWS continued to launch services for customers as needs arose.

*Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud* (EC2) is the service that allows AWS customers to launch instances in the cloud.  EC2 was the first abstraction introduced. 

*Amazon Lightsail* is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers, small businesses, students, and other users who need a simple virtual private server (VPS) solution. Lightsail provides developers compute, storage, and networking capacity and capabilities to deploy and manage websites and web applications in the cloud.
