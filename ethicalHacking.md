# Ethical hacking: Log Tampering 101

Computer logs are designed to track everything that happens on the computer. Ethical hackers need to understand the implications of this since hackers like to erase their logs in order to avoid detection and implication. 

## The process

Four Steps:

1. Disable auditing
2. Claring logs
3. Modifying logs
4. Erasing command history

## Disable Auditing

Turn off only the logs that track the hacking activity.

## Clearing Logs

Clearlogs.exe is often used for this. This can be checked by opening the security logs to verify.

## Meterpreter

Helps all logs in a Windows system.

## Windows Event Viewer

Clearing logs in Windows Event Viewer is also a good idea.

## Linux Systems

Use a Shred tool.
