## What is Virtualization?

*According to Tech Target (2017), the “Virtualization is the creation of a virtual, rather than actual, version of something.” (Virtualization, 2017).*

## Virtualization with Amazon IaaS

Delivers virtualized computer infrastructure in the form of a service. 

 *“The relationship of the hypervisor to the host operating system and to the virtual machine is one of the key distinguishing characteristics of the different virtualization systems.”* (Amies, Sluiman, and Tong, 2017).

 IN EC2 Amazon also uses AMI (Amazon Machine Image). A virtual appliance. 

 Virtualization allows Amazon to run different types of virtual machines of various sizes on top of their hardware. Amazon heavily uses virtualization through capabilities offered by Xen hypervisor and Amazon AMI.
