Similar to cybersecurity, cyber forensic specialists are charged with helping increase security, fight crime, and create a better, safer future.

## Computer Forensic Careers

Experts that recover documents, photos, emails, and other files from computer systems, hard drives, and other devices. They often work on “cyber crime” and digital cases and examine computer systems to help find digital evidence of illegal activity.

## Forensics vs Cybersecurity

 At the root, cybersecurity is focused on prevention while computer forensics is more reactionary in nature.

 Both fields work in tandem to mitigate and stop threats.
