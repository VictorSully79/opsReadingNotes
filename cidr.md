CIDR notation is a way of representing a CIDR block or a range of IP addresses.

The goal is to have enough IP addreses without making the block too large.

An IPv4 (version 4 of IP) address is usually represented as four 8-bit decimal numbers or octets separated by dots, for example 127.0.0.1 (localhost on most systems). An 8-bit number when represented in the decimal system as opposed to binary has a range of 0â€“255.

This range can be made larger or smaller depending on needs.
