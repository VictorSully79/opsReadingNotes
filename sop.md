SOP, or standard operating procedure, is typically a written guideline describing the way things are done in an organization.

SOP's come in many shapes and sizes.  Some more useful than others. 

## Why are SOPs So Important

SOPs are a way company's stay on track.  It gives employees a clear vision of the "Why, What, When and How".  Every Mcdonalds serves the same cheeseburger.  I never have to wonder how a particular Mcdonalds is going to make my cheeseburger no matter what state I am in.  This is do to SOPs.

## Challenges

There is no hard rule for writing an SOP.  Needs often change fast so SOPs need to be updated.

## Make a Plan

Start with a plan. Draw everything out and put it in front of you.  Wireframe, flow chart, whatever you need to have a clear vision. Make sure there are enough detail in your SOP but not so much that people won't read it.  

## Guiding Principles

- Keep it Simple
- SOPs must be portable
- Flowcharts and diagrams tell a story
- Consistency counts
- It's about the audience
