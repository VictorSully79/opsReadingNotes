# What are YARA rules

notes taken from <https://archerint.com/what-are-yara-rules/>

YARA is a tool that you can use to track down malware in your computer or network. The custom rules you create could help save you if a nefarious actor comes along. The rules also work on email.

YARA rules can be very specific and can deal with all aspects of a file.  This makes YARA rules only as good as they are written.
