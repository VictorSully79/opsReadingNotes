Domains allows for the settings of multiple computers to be controlled by a Domain Controller.

## What is a Domain

Windows domains provide network administrators with a way to manage a large number of PCs and control them from one place. One or more servers (domain controllers) have control over the domain and the computers on it. 

Most computers in a domain are on the same local network. In the case of company or school laptops that leave the network they can still be controlled by the domain through VPN or Internet connection.

User names and passwords are kept by the domain controller and the controller can overide local settins.

## Workgroups vs Domains

If a computer is not joined to a Domain it is part of a workgroup.  No one computer has control over the others in a workgroup.
