# PS1 - Should you learn PowerShell?
notes taken from the above named websit: <https://www.techthoughts.info/ps1-should-you-learn-powershell/>

## Deciding

Powershell is a command line interface from Microsoft that enables system administrators and power users to access the command line for computer management.

It allows for scripting to automate tasks.

## PowerShell vs Other Languages

Most traditional languages are used to build websites and applications. On the contrary, PowerShell is used for doing things.  The applications built by other programs are often stored on servers managed with PowerShell commands.

## Whats in a Shell

Most engineers gravitate toward Linus or Windows. This typically leads to two outcomes.

- Linux ->Bash->Python
- Windows ->PowerShell->C#

## PowerShell vs Bash

Bash pushes around text, whereas PowerShell passes around data objects.

## Strings vs Objects

The use of strings can be beneficial because the information can be manipulated and parsed to get the information you need. Objects on the other hand can be more difficult to work with.

PowerShell can be used on most major platforms.

## Why Powershell

- Automation leads to tasks being completed faster.
- Accuracy
- Versatility
- Community
- Relevant

Automated scripts are now more common that malware.

57% of attacks in 2018 used PowerShell scripts to execute in memory without significantly touching the file system.

This is important because the bad guy no longer has to direct the machine to download, install, save and execute a trojan payload.
