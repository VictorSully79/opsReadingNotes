# Penetration Testing

notes taken from <https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/penetration-testing/>

A penetration test, also known as a pen test, is a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. In the context of web application security, penetration testing is commonly used to augment a web application firewall (WAF).
