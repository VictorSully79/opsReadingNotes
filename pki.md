## What is PKI?

Public Key Infrastructure is a technology used in authenticating users and devices in the digital world.

The common uses involve web sites and user/computer authentications.

SSH uses certificates.

The main weakness is the fact any certificate authority can sign a cert for any person or comnputer. This leads to the question of "Who can be trusted"
