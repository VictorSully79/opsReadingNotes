## SOC 2

Service Organization Control 2 or (SOC 2) provides a framework that shows organizations are prioritizing key attributes: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

SOC 2 is based around five "Trust Principles". Companies choose the principle they want the auditor to attest to. Usually this will be what is most important to the companies customers. 

1. Security: The foundational security principle, commoon to all audits.
2. Availability: Protection that systems or data will be available as agreed or required. 
3. Integrity: Protection that systems or data are not changed in an unauthorized manner.
4. Confidentiality: Protection from unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.
5. Privacy: The use, collection, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information is protected.

## Audit Process

Companies can spend six months to one year in preperation. The company will then schedule an auditor to conduct the audit.

Type I Audits deal with a single point in time while Type II audits deal with the past six months.

## Why

Key Reasons:

1. It Improves Security
2. It Bolsters Company Culture
3. It Provides Documentation
