A big part of IT is troubleshooting. Completely understanding the problem and being able to duplicate it goes a long way. Often times there are multiple problems caused by the same root issue.

A system to evaluate these problems is needed to get consistent results.

1. Ask a lot of questions.

2. Hypothesis about what caused the problems.

3. Consider all the scenerios.

4. Test theories.

5. Implement the solution.

6. Test that it worked.

7. Create preventative measures.
